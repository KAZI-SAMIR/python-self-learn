### Time-related things

The official documentation for the time module is
[here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html).

```python
>>> import time
>>> time.sleep(1)   # wait one second
>>> time.time()     # return time in seconds since beginning of the year 1970
1474896325.2394648
>>> time.strftime('%d.%m.%Y %H:%M:%S')  # format current time nicely
'07.04.2017 19:08:33'
>>>
```

You are probably wondering how `time.time()` can be used and why its
timing starts from the beginning of 1970. `time.time()` is useful for
measuring time differences because we can save its return value to a
variable before doing something, and then afterwards check how much it
changed. There's an example that does this in [the example
section](#examples).

If you want to know why it starts from 1970 you can read something like
[this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1090869/why-is-1-1-1970-the-epoch-time).
See `help(time.strftime)` if you want to know about more format
specifiers like `%d`, `%m` etc. that `time.strftime` can take.
